In todayâ€™s world, security is a growing concern across residential, commercial, and public domains. Traditional surveillance systems often rely on manual monitoring, which is prone to human error and inefficiency in identifying potential threats in real-time. To address these challenges, this project introduces an intelligent thief detection system that leverages real-time video analysis powered by Python-based image processing and machine learning techniques. The system utilizes popular libraries such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and Kera's to efficiently process video feeds, detect anomalies, and classify behaviours as normal or suspicious. Key image processing methods like background subtraction, motion detection, and object tracking are employed to identify and monitor moving objects in a scene. These techniques enable the isolation of dynamic elements from static backgrounds and allow the system to track objects over time to predict their behaviour's.To enhance decision-making, machine learning models are trained using Scikit-learn and Kera's, enabling the system to recognize complex patterns and distinguish between harmless and potentially harmful activities. By integrating advanced classification techniques, the system evolves with continued use, improving its ability to identify threats accurately over time.When suspicious activities are detected, the system triggers immediate alerts, records the incidents, and generates visual summaries for security personnel. This ensures prompt responses to potential threats while creating a record of events for post-incident analysis. The platform also features a user-friendly dashboard for remote monitoring, making it accessible and practical for various users, including homeowners, businesses, and public safety organizations.
